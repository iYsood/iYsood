- 👋 Hi, I’m Abdulrahman Alshammari @iYsood  
- 🧠 Passionate full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend technologies, system architecture, and automation.  
- 👀 I’m deeply interested in building secure platforms, training systems, control panels, and custom Laravel-based solutions.  
- 🌱 Currently expanding my skills in ethical hacking, Lua (for game scripting), and Python (for automation and tooling).  
- 🛡️ I care deeply about system security, access control, and clean, maintainable code.  
- 💬 I love solving complex problems with simple, modular code — always aiming for efficiency over complexity.  
- 💞️ Open to collaborating on security-focused tools, Laravel packages, and creative automation scripts.
